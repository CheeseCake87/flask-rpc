Flask Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a simple
library that allows you to expose functions
in your Flask application to be called
remotely. It is designed to be straightforward
to use and easy to understand.

Flask-RPC does not follow any current already existing
RPC standard, but uses its own standard,
and primarily works with JSON over HTTP POST
requests to call functions.

The typical request/response cycle is as follows:

**Request**

```json
{
  "frpc": 1.0,
  "function": "add_numbers",
  "data": [
    1,
    2,
    3
  ]
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "frpc": 1.0,
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Function 'add_numbers' executed successfully",
  "data": 6
}
```

## Usage

[This repo](https://github.com/CheeseCake87/flask-rpc) contains a working example of Flask-RPC.

It also includes an example of using the [JS library](https://github.com/CheeseCake87/flask-rpc-js) that helps
in making requests via fetch to Flask-RPC.

### Simplest example

```python
from flask import Flask

from flask_rpc.latest import RPC, RPCResponse


def add_numbers(data):
    if isinstance(data, list):
        return RPCResponse.success(
            sum(data),
            "Function 'add_numbers' executed successfully"
        )


app = Flask(__name__)
rpc = RPC(app, url_prefix="/rpc")  # or RPC(blueprint)
rpc.functions(
    add_numbers=add_numbers
)
```

`RPC(...)`

Will register a POST route with the app or blueprint that you pass in.

`rpc.functions(...)`

Will register the functions that you pass in to be called remotely. 
The argument names used will be the name of the function you will call remotely, for example:

```python
rpc.functions(
    add_numbers=add_numbers,
    subtract=subtract_numbers
)
```

Calling `subtract` remotely will call the `subtract_numbers` function.

A request to the `/rpc` endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```python
import requests
from flask_rpc import RPCRequest


response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5000/rpc",
    json=RPCRequest.build(
        function="add_numbers",
        data=[1, 2, 3]
    )
)
```

or, if you're using the [JS library](https://github.com/CheeseCake87/flask-rpc-js):

```js
fetch("/rpc", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: frpc(
    function_="add_numbers",
    data=[1, 2, 3]
  )
})
```

Will return:

```json
{
  "frpc": 1.0,
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Function 'add_numbers' executed successfully",
  "data": 6
}
```
